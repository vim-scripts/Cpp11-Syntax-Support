This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3797

Modified existing c.vim and cpp.vim (into cpp11.vim and cpp11_cbase.vim) to add support for new language features found in C++11.

* Initialiser lists and lambdas no longer cause curly error highlighting ({} allowed within parentheses).
* constexpr, nullptr, static_assert, decltype, override & final keyword added.
* New Unicode and raw string literals added.


I'm adding features as I hit them - if something is bugging you and not yet added, let me know.
